A collection of spreadsheets. Use [Gnumeric](http://www.gnumeric.org/)

I have written a plugin for gnumeric which uses the API from my flask-site. 
gnumeric lets you define a custom function and provides a python hook. 
More info on this official site. Alternately look at [gnumeric-py](http://www.bruunisejs.dk/PythonHacks/rstFiles/500%20Notes%20on%20spreadsheets%20etc.html).

Similar plugins can easily be written for MS-EXCEL etc. If anyone can help me with this please contact. 
Possibly, consider using xlloop which allows you to define server based functions for MS-excel.
