# Sun Dance - Security Analysis
---


## Motivation and Description
A fun project to identify under valued assets, mainly securities analysis. 

I basically built a web-crawler to retrive financial statements (income statements, 
balance sheet, cashflow statements).

Read books especially from value investors like Ben Graham etc. Other
sources like investopedia etc to build scripts that can scan all the listings of 
HKEX (for now, plan on other exchanges later). 

Transfer some of the machine learning techniques to analyse and potentially make a
buck or two.
